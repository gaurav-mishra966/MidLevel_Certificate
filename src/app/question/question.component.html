<h1> Git Hub Feature Implementation Solution</h1>
<p>Problem Statement</p>
<p>In this application, we want to filter a list of GitHub repositories based on name and programming language.

    The app uses components/repository.component.ts and its existing template to display each repository in the list.

    When the user changes the "Name" or "Programming Language", the page must refresh and filter the list of
    repositories.

    Both filters must work separately and must also work together.</p>

<p>Requirements</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The repositories are read from services/repository.service.ts and use components/repository.component.ts to
        render
        each of them.
    </li>
    <li>
        Bind existing name and language variables to the template(see app.component.ts file).<br>
        ðŸ’¡ HINT: How do we create bindings for reading and writing input-control values?
    </li>
    <li>When the name value changes, refresh the list of repositories and show the items that match or contain the
        entered
        text.
        Use the full_name attribute from Repository interface.</li>
    <li>
        When the language value changes, refresh the list of repositories and show the items that match or contain the
        entered text.
        Use the language attribute from Repository interface.
    </li>
    <li>
        Both filters must be used independently or at the same time.
    </li>
    <li>
        If no matches are found. Render the "No matches found" message.<br>
        ðŸ’¡ HINT: How do we display something when there are no items in the collection?

    </li>
    <li>
        Notes: Do NOT rename any existing variables,Use proper types for you data. Do NOT use any or Object or as data
        types.
    </li>
</ul>
